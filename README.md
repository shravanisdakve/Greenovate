# Greenovate
Greenovate is a web-based platform that makes environmental education engaging and practical through gamification. It combines interactive modules, quizzes, storytelling missions, and real-world eco-tasks (tree planting, waste segregation, reducing plastic use) with a rewards system of points, badges, and ranks.
